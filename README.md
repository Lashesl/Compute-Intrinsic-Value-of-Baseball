# Compute-Intrinsic-Value-of-Baseball

Purpose:

Use data from biomechanics and pitch tracking to visualize and predict. Find the optimal strategy for each pitcher, visualize and predict pitchers' performances in order to develope proper tranning plans.

Solution:

Features: Forward trunk tilt, sideways trunk tilt, shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, location of a pitch, pitch movement
Combine bayesian framework, kernel density and nonparametric regression estimate compute intrinsic pitch values.
Use nash equilibrium to count Nash score of each pitchers to find optimal strategy of pitchers.
